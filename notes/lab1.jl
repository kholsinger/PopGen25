# One great reason to like Julia: Pluto

While the goal is to get you all to have scripts in a language you are comfortable working in, I hope you'll at least take a glance at `Julia`. One of the reasons it works well is it has very nice interactive abilities in the form of its `Pluto` package. We'll take a moment to set-up and get this notebook running for yourself, but after this lecture we'll work more free-form and let you use whatever language you desire.

## A bit about Pluto

In Pluto, everything is structured as a bunch of `cells`. Each `cell` can contain code. Even text (like this) is really just markdown under the hood. Notice a few bits of UI before we start.

1) Look to the top right. There might be a button there that says "Run this notebook". Click that! A bunch of things will start happening as the notebook compiles and runs in the background.

2) On the bottom right, you should see two buttons: "Live docs" and "Status". Click them!

- Live docs will bring up Julia's documentation on any function you have your cursor over. This can help you remember syntax when needed.

- Status lets you know what Pluto is actually doing at the moment. Useful to see if things are just running, or are stuck evaluating a cell, etc.

3) There should be a closed eye icon to the left of this text block. This just means the code for this block is being hidden. Click it and see what happens (you might need to scroll down a bit, this is a long block of text).

4) There's a plus icon above and below the text block, just to the left. Clicking these will create a new cell above/below the current one.

Now that you are hopefully slightly oriented, let's do some coding!

# Wright-Fisher simulations

Today's goal is to take what we have learned in the lecture and discussion, and create Wright-Fisher simulators that we can use as toy models for the rest of the semester. These will necessarily be over-simplified, but they are here just to give you a chance to test your intuition. 

To make this scalable, we'll write two functions. The first is the backbone of the simulations - it's a loop that takes a bunch of initial parameters and returns a time series of allele frequencies.

`Julia` code is mostly readable to human eyes without straining too heavily, but I've added lots of comments (text following a '#' symbol is ignored by `Julia`) to help explain each line
"""

In the cell above, we define how the WrightFisher process should work. We track the allele frequency each generation, starting from $g$ = 1 to $t$. Each generation, the next generation's frequency is just the result of `randomMating` on the previous generation's allele frequency.

But, what is the `randomMating()` function? Well, we define it below. 
"""

md"""
And here we run the actual random sampling function. Recall from lecture that it's really just a `Binomial` sample with probability $p$ and $N$ new individuals each generation, but we need the proportion of successes, so we divide the result by $N$.

Let's see if this works! One nice thing about interactive notebooks, is as we change initial parameters the code is quickly re-run. In fact, we can also add fun things like sliders for initial frequency:

_p_ = $(@bind p Slider(0:0.01:1,show_value=true;default=0.5))

If you are finding things are running slow, you can try messing with these parameters:

_sims_ (the number of independent simulations to run) = $(@bind sims NumberField(1:10:1000;default=200))

_k_ (keep results every $k^{th}$ generation) = $(@bind k NumberField(1:10;default=1))
"""

An odd, but in some ways nice, thing about Pluto is that the bindings of the parameters can change in later cells (the whole thing is evaluated for inter-dependencies, and cells are re-run in the necessary order). So, even though we run the simulations in cells above, if you change the number of generations we simulate for (_t_) or the population size (_N_) below, you'll update the figure above as well!

## Going beyond standard Wright-Fisher

Today we talked about how the standard assumptions of the WF model can often be broken. Indeed, we saw how some alleles increase in frequency much more rapidly than expected under WF.

There are two potential reasons in these populations - they don't experience migration, and mating is as random as they can manage, so the allele frequency wonkiness is either due to mutation, or selection.

### Mutation


One of the most important ways WF is wrong is in not accounting for `mutation`. This is a fairly simple thing to include in our broad model, since we can make mutation quite general.

Mutation can be thought of as a random event during the production of gametes (so before formation of the next generation). A gamete which _should_ carry the `a` allele will instead carry an `A`, or vice-versa. In the most general model, the probability of both events is equal and is given as $\mu$. To add it to our code, we need to define one new functions, and modify our WrightFisher function as well.

We'll save computational time by simplifying mutation - recall that we produce _infinite_ gametes, so we don't need to do random sampling for them. The allele frequencies can change deterministically.

Try to fill out the code below yourself, there should be helpful hints that pop up.

We can then define our mutation rate for simulations to be:

### Selection

Selection can be implemented in a variety of ways. For now, we'll implement the most general of these. Let's suppose the number of gametes is still infinite, but the proportion of gametes that each individual contributes now depends on its genotype. The fitness of `aa` will be considered the reference fitness, so their fitness ($W_{aa}$) will be set to 1. We can then specify the relative fitness of `Aa` and `AA` individuals. From theory you'll learn in a few weeks, the frequency of the allele after selection is:

"""

# ╔═╡ 5908f3ea-77ad-44f4-a985-22fb752b2b93

# ╔═╡ aa82cb4b-e23a-4748-9d1f-5153535e0978
md"""
In the above:

$w_{AA}, w_{Aa}$ are the relative fitnesses of `AA` and `Aa` individuals, respectively,

$p_{AA}, p_{Aa}$ are their frequencies. 

If the population is in Hardy-Weinberg before gametes are produced (it should be), then you should already know how to go from $p$ to $p_{AA}$.

Let's make a function that can modify the allele frequencies due to selection. Just fill out the below with the quantity in Eq $(eqref("sel")).
"""

# ╔═╡ 98d5e5a3-f7fc-4d7a-9cea-6dbf9d23d074

	next = missing #Edit this line

# ╔═╡ b95d6076-aaf0-4df7-9b32-d98aaebdb14b

We next need to modify the WrightFisher equation to include selection.

There's different ways of approaching this, but we'll go for a relatively simple one that will only require a single parameter by focusing on directional selection.

Specifically, we'll think of the case where `AA` has twice the effect of `Aa`, and the fitness of `Aa` is _1+s_.
