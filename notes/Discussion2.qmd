# Discussion 2

## Richard Lewontin

![Lewontin is famous for a lot of things: levels of selection, niche construction, spandrels, etc.](images/paste-1.jpeg)

In our case - Lewontin's Paradox

## Lewontin's Paradox

Various formulations, my preferred:

Population sizes vary over \~10 orders of magnitude, mutation over \~3, but diversity only around 2. Why?

. . . 

Favorite pastime of population geneticists: come up with an explanation.

. . .

Demography, selection, mutation bias.

## Demographic explanations

Populations fluctuate, and they never really recover to equilbrium state. Bigger pops fluctuate more.

. . .

Populations were tiny at time of speciation, and there's enough speciation that you are never at equilbrium.

. . .

## Mutation bias

Bigger populations have smaller mutation rates.

. . .

Mutations can only generate so much genetic diversity (caps at 3/4 for some models).

. . .

Gene conversion is biased?

## Selection

Nearly-neutral theory

. . .

Hitchhiking

. . .

Background selection

. . .

Recurrent sweeps

## Discussion today

Again, in small groups:

1) Which reasons does Vince think are compelling explanations for LP?

2) What reasons do _you_ think best explain the paradox, and why?

3) For your favorite explanation, try to think of data you'd need to test it.
