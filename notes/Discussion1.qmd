# Discussion 1

## Quizlet 1 Answers

1)  Alleles initially appear at a frequency of 1/N in haploid, 1/2N in diploid populations.

2)  Fixation probability is $p_0$, so 1/N (1/2N)

3)  Evolution seems to happen more rapidly in small populations - mutations are lost or fixed faster. BUT - this is ignoring any other evolutionary forces.

## Long Term Evolutionary Experiments (LTEE)

Broadly popular type of study:

-   Put a population in a new environment and track it

-   Popular with yeast/bacteria, since ancestral populations can easily be preserved

-   Useful to test how adaptation happens in the lab

-   Useful to test how adaptation differs in slightly different circumstances

## Leu et al 2020

## What did they actually do?

## Why did they do this?

. . .

Long-standing hypotheses about why sex even exists.

. . .

One with a lot of backing - adaptation is faster in sexual organisms (they avoid Clonal Interference)

We'll talk more about Clonal interference in Week 3.

. . .

LTEE experiments find mixed results - sometimes asexual evolve slower, other times equal.

. . .

State of the art only in haploids!

## Let's discuss

In small groups (4-5), try to figure out the following:

1\) What are some expected advantages of sexual reproduction? What are the disadvantages? Which ones are supported in this study?

2\) Why do the authors believe asexuals adapted as quickly/sexuals more slowly?

3\) Try to enumerate the actual differences between sexual and asexual treatments.

## Takeaways

Really cool experiment!

. . .

Unclear why asexual populations showed any fitness increase - not any of the individual mutations they identified.

. . .

## Let's look at the data!

Supplementary Data File 1 (available online, or on the github for this class).

. . .

In lab, we'll see how Wright-Fisher simulations can match up to this data (if they can)
