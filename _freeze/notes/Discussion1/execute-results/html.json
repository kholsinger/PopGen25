BUT - this is ignoring any other evolutionary forces.\n\n## Long Term Evolutionary Experiments (LTEE)\n\nBroadly popular type of study:\n\n-   Put a population in a new environment and track it\n\n-   Popular with yeast/bacteria, since ancestral populations can easily be preserved\n\n-   Useful to test how adaptation happens in the lab\n\n-   Useful to test how adaptation differs in slightly different circumstances\n\n## Leu et al 2020\n\n![](images/paste-1.png)\n\n## What did they actually do?\n\n![](images/paste-2.png)\n\n## Why did they do this?\n\n. . .\n\nLong-standing hypotheses about why sex even exists.\n\n. . .\n\nOne with a lot of backing - adaptation is faster in sexual organisms (they avoid Clonal Interference)\n\nWe'll talk more about Clonal interference in Week 3.\n\n. . .\n\nLTEE experiments find mixed results - sometimes asexual evolve slower, other times equal.\n\n. . .\n\nState of the art only in haploids!\n\n## Let's discuss\n\nIn small groups (4-5), try to figure out the following:\n\n1\\) What are some expected advantages of sexual reproduction? What are the disadvantages? Which ones are supported in this study?\n\n2\\) Why do the authors believe asexuals adapted as quickly/sexuals more slowly?\n\n3\\) Try to enumerate the actual differences between sexual and asexual treatments.\n\n## Figure 2\n\n![](images/paste-3.png)\n\n## Figure 3\n\n![](images/paste-4.png)\n\n## Figure 4\n\n![](images/paste-5.png)\n\n## Takeaways\n\nReally cool experiment!\n\n. . .\n\nUnclear why asexual populations showed any fitness increase - not any of the individual mutations they identified.\n\n. . .\n\n## Let's look at the data!\n\nSupplementary Data File 1 (available online, or on the github for this class).\n\n. . .\n\nIn lab, we'll see how Wright-Fisher simulations can match up to this data (if they can)\n\n",
