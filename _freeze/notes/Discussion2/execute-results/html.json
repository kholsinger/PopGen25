Why?\n\n. . . \n\nFavorite pastime of population geneticists: come up with an explanation.\n\n. . .\n\nDemography, selection, mutation bias.\n\n## Demographic explanations\n\nPopulations fluctuate, and they never really recover to equilbrium state. Bigger pops fluctuate more.\n\n. . .\n\nPopulations were tiny at time of speciation, and there's enough speciation that you are never at equilbrium.\n\n. . .\n\n## Mutation bias\n\nBigger populations have smaller mutation rates.\n\n. . .\n\nMutations can only generate so much genetic diversity (caps at 3/4 for some models).\n\n. . .\n\nGene conversion is biased?\n\n## Selection\n\nNearly-neutral theory\n\n. . .\n\nHitchhiking\n\n. . .\n\nBackground selection\n\n. . .\n\nRecurrent sweeps\n\n# Buffalo 2021\n\n![](images/paste-2.jpeg){width=\"816\"}\n\n## Discussion today\n\nAgain, in small groups:\n\n1) Which reasons does Vince think are compelling explanations for LP?\n\n2) What reasons do _you_ think best explain the paradox, and why?\n\n3) For your favorite explanation, try to think of data you'd need to test it.\n\n",
